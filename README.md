# FlappyBirdGodot
A crappy Flappy Bird Clone made using the Godot engine, it's bad.

This was made using Godot 4.1 on Debian 12.

It uses (Most of) the assets from the original Flappy Bird for Android/iOS/Whatever mobile OSes existed at the time (I miss you Windows Phone)

The engine has been set to get rid of (Mostly) everything we don't need.

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open Godot and import this project
3. Export it for whatever you want
